# anime-girl-chatbot

In this repo, we will create an anime girl imitator chatbot using ChatGPT and Python.


## Installation

First, create an OpenAI API key from the [OpenAI website](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api). If you haven't installed poetry yet, please install it.

```bash
pip install poetry
```

After cloning this repository, install the packages with poetry.

```bash
poetry install --with dev
```
